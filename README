This is pyshaper, a dynamic traffic-shaper application for Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x

pyshaper allows you to set minimum and maximum bandwidth
for active TCP/IP connections.

In contrast with many other shaping applications, pyshaper:
    
    - is relatively easy and uncomplicated to use
    - lets you shape traffic on all kinds of criteria, like:
        - local/remote IP address/port (nothing special)
        - pid of local program
        - username in which local program is running
        - program invocation command, and arguments
        - country in which remote peer resides

For example, you can set up a configuration that sets a traffic cap
on all peer2peer connections to overseas hosts, or sets a traffic
cap on all connections made by a specific user.

pyshaper runs typically as a daemon, periodically taking an inventory
of all TCP connections to/from external hosts, and matching them against
the rules in your configuration.

To install and deploy pyshaper, refer to the INSTALL file in this directory.

Rename pyshaper.conf.example to pyshaper.conf and run it with

    PYSHAPERCONFIG=$PWD/pyshaper.conf pyshaper

to avoid installing stuff in /etc.
