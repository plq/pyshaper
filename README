This is pyshaper, a dynamic traffic-shaper application for Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x

pyshaper allows you to set minimum and maximum bandwidth
for active TCP/IP connections.

In contrast with many other shaping applications, pyshaper:
    
    - is relatively easy and uncomplicated to use
    - lets you shape traffic on all kinds of criteria, like:
        - local/remote IP address/port (nothing special)
        - pid of local program
        - username in which local program is running
        - program invocation command, and arguments
        - country in which remote peer resides

For example, you can set up a configuration that sets a traffic cap
on all peer2peer connections to overseas hosts, or sets a traffic
cap on all connections made by a specific user.

pyshaper runs typically as a daemon, periodically taking an inventory
of all TCP connections to/from external hosts, and matching them against
the rules in your configuration.

To install and deploy pyshaper, refer to the INSTALL file in this directory.
