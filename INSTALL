    - if you want to run the optional GUI front end, you'll also need:
        
        - python tkinter
        - Tk 8.4 or later (http://www.tcl.tk)
        - python megawidgets (http://pmw.sourceforge.net)
        - tcpdump


Installation:
    
    - make sure you are running a kernel with at least all of the above options
    
    - type 'make install'

    - the installer creates a directory '/etc/pyshaper', and puts files
      pyshaper.conf and pyshaper.conf.readme in there. pyshaper is hardwired
      to look for this file on startup (and upon forced reload signals)

Running:
    
    - edit the /etc/pyshaper/pyshaper.conf file to your satisfaction

    - become root, and type 'pyshaper --help' to see the available options

    - once you have created a valid pyshaper.conf, and pyshaper is running
      ok with your configuration, you can run a separate pyshaper process
      in gui mode, which allows you to see and change bandwidth usage
      in real time.

    - to run the GUI, just run pyshaper with no arguments
